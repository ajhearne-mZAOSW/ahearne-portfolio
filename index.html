                    Hello! I am Alana Hearne, an Electrical Engineer based in Sydney, Australia. With a strong background in Lean and Six Sigma methodologies, I have a proven track record of enhancing manufacturing processes, significantly boosting throughput, and reducing waste. Throughout my career, I have spearheaded initiatives that streamline operations and improve product quality, such as redesigning manufacturing departments and establishing robust procedural guidelines. 
                    <br><br>
                    My hands-on experience in root cause analysis, process design, and team leadership has enabled me to lead cross-functional teams effectively, ensuring seamless product flow and successful integration of new processes. With a First Class Honours degree in Electrical Engineering and a focus on Biomedical Engineering, I bring a blend of technical expertise and strategic thinking to every project.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm currently working for a local start-up developing a zero-emissions, hydrogen-battery powered vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle by day, and delving into the programming world by night.

                <p>
                    As I'm just at the beginning of my programming journey, my portflio might look a little thin. Be sure to check back from time to time to see what new things I've been working on and how I'm progressing.
                    <br><br>
                    Check out some of the work I've done so far!
